RepoFinder is a versatile Python script designed to help users efficiently discover and download GitHub repositories based on any topic of interest. Users can input their search query and specify how many top repositories they want to retrieve. The script automatically searches GitHub, retrieves popular repositories related to the query, and clones them into a local "projects" directory. Ideal for developers, researchers, and students, RepoFinder streamlines the process of finding and accessing valuable open-source resources in any field.
